Automated push to GitHub test file

Everything appears to be broken... :(

I am getting a caught error message relating to creating the KeyPair object, but I am not sure what is causing it. So I added more information to the print statement...

Try 2, issues with syntax.

Public key is not being read in correctly.
^^
Don't need public key I don't think, but we're gonna leave it in there

Added config file to get around security of GitHub (hopefully)
