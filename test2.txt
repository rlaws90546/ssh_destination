Automated push to GitHub test file

SSH agent was sharing the keys... so now I have to retry...

 - Check 2 --> used different SshdSessionFactory initialization without configure (PASSED)

 - Check 3 --> used different SshdSessionFactory initialization (builder instead of new keyword) (PASSED)

 - Check 4 --> changed the location of the private key file to something other than "/.ssh" (PASSED)
    - Also, added date and time to end of commit messages

 - Check 5 --> create temporary file (and set location for the file) to hold private key passed as parameter (PASSED)

 - Check 6 --> trying to add and commit changes to whole directory, not just singular file (PASSED)

Trying to check functionality when the config file is removed...
